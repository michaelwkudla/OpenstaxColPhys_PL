  <markdown>Two unruly campers get a wild-eyed notion. The want to float on their air mattress on the lake. A twin-sized air mattress used for camping has dimensions of {{params.d1}} $cm$ by {{params.d2}} $cm$ by {{params.d3}} $cm$ when blown up. 
    The weight of the mattress is {{params.m}} $kg$. How much can the mattress support if it is put on the water?
