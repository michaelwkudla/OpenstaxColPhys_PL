  <markdown>An ultrasound wave passes first through fat tissue of thickness ${{params.t1}} mm$ and then 
    through muscle tissue of thickness ${{params.t2}} mm$  before reflecting back towards the detector. 
    How long does it take for the ultrasound wave to return to the detector from when it was sent?
    Assume the speed of sound in fat is ${{params.vfat}} m/s$ and the speed of sound in muscle is ${{params.vmuscle}} m/s$.
