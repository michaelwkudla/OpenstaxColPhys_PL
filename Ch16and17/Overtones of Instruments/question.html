    <markdown> If a wind instrument, such as a tuba, has a fundamental
      frequency of {{params.f1}} $Hz$, what are its first three overtones?
      It is closed at one end. (The overtones of a real tuba are
      more complex than this example, because it is a tapered
      tube.)

      <markdown> What are the first three overtones of a bassoon that has
        a fundamental frequency of {{params.f2}} $Hz$? It is open at both
        ends. (The overtones of a real bassoon are more complex
        than this example, because its double reed makes it act
        more like a tube closed at one end.)
