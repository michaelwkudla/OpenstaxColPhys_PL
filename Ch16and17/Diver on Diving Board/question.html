  <markdown>A diver on a diving board is undergoing simple harmonic motion. Her mass is ${{params.m1}}$ $kg$ and the period of her motion is ${{params.T1}} s$. The next diver is a male whose
    period of simple harmonic oscillation is ${{params.T2}} s$. What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?
