  <markdown>Suppose you have a device that extracts energy from ocean breakers in direct proportion to their intensity. 
    If the device produces ${{params.P}}$ $kW$ of power on a day when the breakers are ${{params.h1}}$ $m$ high, how much will it produce when they are ${{params.h2}}$ $m$ high?
