  <markdown> Nikita Mazepin has spun to a stop on the track yet again during a qualifying session. ${{params.d}} m$ behind him, 
    George Russell is on a fast lap at a speed of ${{params.v}} km/hr$.

        <markdown>Assuming George has four ceramic-carbon rotors, each at a temperature of ${{params.T1}} ^{\circ} C$ each with a mass of ${{params.mrotor}} kg$, and assuming all braking energy is converted to 
          heat energy in the brake rotors, what is the final temperature of the rotors once the car has stopped? You may assume the ceramic-carbon rotors have a specific heat of ${{params.c}} {J/kg*K}$.
