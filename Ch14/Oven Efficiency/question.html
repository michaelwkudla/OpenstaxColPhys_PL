  <markdown>Ovens are an everyday utility which almost everyone uses. However, they are terribly inefficient. A cake with mass ${{params.m_cake}} kg$ 
    is heated in an oven from ${{params.T1}} ^{\circ} C$ to ${{params.T2}} ^{\circ} C$. You can assume the cake has a specific heat capacity of
    ${{params.c_cake}} kJ/(kg*K)$.

      <markdown>If there is ${{params.m_air}} kg$ of air in the oven and the inside of the oven has ${{params.m_steel}} kg$ of steel, 
        both of which are also heated from ${{params.T1}} ^{\circ} C$ to ${{params.T2}} ^{\circ} C$, how much energy is put into the
        whole oven system (including the cake, air, and steel inside)? $c_{air} = {{params.c_air}} kJ/(kg*K), c_{steel} = {{params.c_steel}} kJ/(kg*K)$.
