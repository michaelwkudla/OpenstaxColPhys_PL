  <markdown>A walrus transfers energy by conduction through its blubber at the rate of ${{params.Qrate}} W$ 
    when immersed in ${{params.T1}} ^{\circ}C$ water. 
    The walrusâ€™s internal core temperature is ${{params.T2}} ^{\circ}C$, and it has a surface area of ${{params.A}} m^2$. 
    What is the average thickness of its blubber, which has the conductivity of fatty tissues 
    without blood?
