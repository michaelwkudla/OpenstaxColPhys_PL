  <markdown>The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii is the worldâ€™s most active, disgorging about ${{params.V}} m^3$ of ${{params.T1}} ^{\circ}C$ lava per day. What is the rate 
    of heat transfer out of Earth by convection if this lava has a density of ${{params.density}} kg/m^3$ and eventually cools to ${{params.T2}} ^{\circ}C$? Assume that 
    the specific heat of lava is the same as that of granite.
