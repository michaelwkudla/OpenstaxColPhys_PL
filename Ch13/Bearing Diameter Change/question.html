  <markdown>A steel bearing with an internal diameter of ${{params.d1}} cm$ is slightly too small to fit onto a shaft of diameter ${{params.d2}} cm$.
    In order to make it fit, we decide to heat up the bearing just enough so it will fit on the shaft. How much do we need to heat the bearing
    in order to make the bearing fit? Assume that the circumference increases proportionally to increase in temperature (in other words, the circumference is $L$). Assume the linear expansion
    coefficient for steel is ${{params.alpha}} { } ^{\circ}C^{-1}$.
